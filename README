SMS and Email Sample 

Created by:  Nathanial Ryan  - Fully Croisened

This is a sample project to demonstrate various ways to send email and text from within your
Corona app.

Project Requireiments:
   Corona SDK Build 714+
   
   MUST RUN ON DEVICE, THIS SAMPLE WILL NOT WORK IN THE SIM
   
   Must have "android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" in your build.settings files as we are going
   to make use of the GPS in this sample

   You need to update the "phone" and "emailTo" properties to something you can test with in the "globals.lua"
   
   I'm making using of my base project template for this sample, hence it is wired up with Director 1.4



The samples...

"Send Email (BLANK)"

Shows the very simplest way to open the email client - users must enter everything themselves


"Send Email (My Location)"

Demonstrates opening the email client, populating properties programatically and embedding the 
user's current GPS long and lat in the body of the message.


"Send Email (With Attachment)"

Demonstrates opening the email client, populating all properties programatically and attaching 
an image from the system.ResourceDirectory

****UPDATE 12-22-2011 THIS FEATURE IS WORKING GREAT ON ANDROID, BUT WHEN I RUN THIS ON IPAD2 THE IMAGE SHOWS UP
IN THE MESSAGE WHEN IT IS CONSTRUCTED, BUT SEEMS IT GETS CORRUPTED ON THE RECEPIENT END - THE FILE IS
THE RIGHT SIZE BUT IT IS JUST A BLANK IMAGE - looking into this...

****UPDATE 12-30-2011
It seems that if you attach .jpg rather than using a .png it will work great on both Android and iOS, so for now
I would recomend using .jpg 


"Send Text (BLANK)"

Shows the simplest way to open the text client - users must enter everything themselves


"Send Text (MY Location)"

Demonstrates opening the text client, populating the phone number and body programatically, and again
we are sending the lat and long of the user's current location over to a recepient.
