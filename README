SMS and Email Sample 

Created by:  Nathanial Ryan  - Fully Croisened

This is a sample project to demonstrate various ways to send email and text from within your
Corona app.

Project Requireiments:
   Corona SDK Build 714+
   
   MUST RUN ON DEVICE, THIS SAMPLE WILL NOT WORK IN THE SIM
   
   Must have "android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" in your build.settings files as we are going
   to make use of the GPS in this sample

   You need to update the "phone" and "emailTo" properties to something you can test with in the "globals.lua"
   
   I'm making using of my base project template for this sample, hence it is wired up with Director 1.4



The samples...

"Send Email (BLANK)"

Shows the very simplest way to open the email client - users must enter everything themselves


"Send Email (My Location)"

Demonstrates opening the email client, populating properties programatically and embedding the 
user's current GPS long and lat in the body of the message.


"Send Email (With Attachment)"

Demonstrates opening the email client, populating all properties programatically and attaching 
an image from the system.DocumentsDirectory

****UPDATE THIS FEATURE IN THE SAMPLE WAS WORKING 12-22 using build 714, but no longer attaches 
the image beginning on 12-23.  I'm guessing this has to do with the "type" property of the attachment
settings.  The attachment shows up on the email at the time it is created, but once you hit send
it is not there on the receiving end



"Send Text (BLANK)"

Shows the simplest way to open the text client - users must enter everything themselves


"Send Text (MY Location)"

Demonstrates opening the text client, populating the phone number and body programatically, and again
we are sending the lat and long of the user's current location over to a recepient.
